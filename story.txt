One day I was eating dinner with my mum.
My mum suggesteds to make a pancake to eat as a dessert after dinner. 
I liked the idea so much, I began to search a pancake recipe online.It took an hour to find a good recipe.
I went to the supermarket to buy banana and chocolate syrup.
My mum and I began to make the pancake.
We began to read the recipe good and add the ingrediants together.
