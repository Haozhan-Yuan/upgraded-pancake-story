One day I was eating dinner with my mum.
My mum suggesteds to make a pancake to eat as a dessert after dinner. 
I liked the idea so much, I began to search a pancake recipe online.
I went to the supermarket to buy banana and chocolate syrup.
My mum and I began to make the pancake.
My mum and I worked for two hours to carefully recreate the delicious pancake recipe. We thinly chopped the banana and added not only chocolate syrup, but also dark chocolate chips. We also made the decision to add nutmeg, a bit of cinnamon, and crushed pecans. We decided to name our variation on the recipe "Lumberjack's Delite", in reference to the tradition of pancake consumption among those in the logging profession.
The loggers loved the pancakes so much they asked for our recipe, then made pancakes for breakfast every day for the rest of the year.
At last, we made a lot of money by making pancake. Life is so good!
